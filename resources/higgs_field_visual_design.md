# Framework of the Limitations on Infinity: Visual Design Scheme

## 1. Design Philosophy

### Overall Visual Direction

A profound, minimalist, and cosmic visual style. The design draws inspiration from the ethereal light paintings of James Turrell and the clean, atmospheric sci-fi aesthetics of films like 'Arrival.' The core concept is to visually represent the abstract ideas of the infinite and the fundamental forces by using a disciplined, minimal language that evokes both clarity and cosmic mystery.

### Content Density

Medium density. Each slide should focus on one to three key concepts, using large-scale imagery and ample negative space (20%-25%) to create a sense of focus and philosophical contemplation. This approach is better suited for conveying abstract ideas and creating an impactful, thought-provoking experience.

## 2. Color System

**Primary Colors**

- Background color: #101116 (Deep cosmic black-blue)

**Text Colors**

## 3. Font Design

**Heading Fonts**

- English fonts
  - Chiron Hei HK (A modern geometric sans-serif with sharp, precise lines, evoking a sense of scientific and cosmic order - used for main titles)
  - Hedvig Letters Sans (A distinctive sans-serif with a unique character, reflecting the personal nature of a philosophical inquiry - used for secondary headings)

**Body Fonts**

- English fonts
  - Quattrocento Sans (A classic and elegant sans-serif, offering high readability and a calm, clear tone for complex ideas - primary body text)
  - Sorts Mill Goudy (A classic serif font with a gentle, scholarly feel, excellent for longer explanatory text - used for quotes and emphasis)

## 4. Image Style

Abstract and atmospheric. Utilize macro photography of light on dark surfaces, minimalist geometric or organic light patterns, and high-contrast black-and-white images of particle tracks or cosmic phenomena. Images should feel conceptual and evocative rather than literal.
